# Sentinel_Trade_Bot
Utilizing ByBit and PyBit development libraries the Sentinel Trade Bot was created. This is in early satages of development and is currently being worked on by two contributors. 


# H1
**Syndicate Trader**

______________________________________________________________________________




## H2
**API key/secret**
On your local machine enter into the directory where you have downloaded the *Syndicate Trader*

Within this directory the folder`../SyndicatedTrader/api_vault_storage`
Once in this folder you will  see two files `key` and `secret`

These are the locations where your *ByBit* api key and secret will be stored. This only needs to be done once (Unless you have an expiration on your key/secret in which you will need to make changes here when needed)

Once input they will be converted to protect the integrity of the key in the chance of a breach of your system. It is suggested that you store a copy of your key/secret in a safe place before you run `SyndicatedTrader` for the first time
